          My story begins when my grandfather gave me my first computer and a
          Raspberry PI to learn electronics. Since that day, I have progressed a
          lot and now, I have reached a good level and I am fulfilled in what I
          do.

          Most of my work is available on my GitHub and I also work for clients.
          I master Python and Java as well as C and C++ for electronics (even
          the Raspberry is programmed in Python), I'm learning databases like
          MySQL and MongoDB for my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also invest in crypto-currencies, my favorite is EGLD, but I also
          like Ethereum and Solana because they are programmable blockchains.
          I'm always available and in a good mood...
